#### Abstract

Statistical analysis on temporal, spatial, graph, and probabilistic data
requires special care to appropriately handle their intrinsic structure.
Outputs from models typically return these composite data types
separately, requiring the user to assemble and apply the results
correctly. This reduces the accessibility of statistics and results in
error-prone analysis. Representing these data types using composite
vector types makes statistical operations and data analysis easier.

In this talk, I will introduce the application of vectorised statistical
operations across common dimensions not otherwise handled in traditional
data structures. The vectors of vectors data type implemented in the
vecvec R package is foundational for creating efficient mixed data
types. The distributional and mixtime R packages leverage vecvec in
order to create vectors that mix different distributions and temporal
granularities together. Storing distributions with different shapes and
parameterisations together in the same vector abstracts away the data
handling complexity while providing a user-friendly interface for
calculating distributional statistics such as the mean, quantiles, and
densities. Similarly, storing time at different granularities allows
combining data from different sources and facilitates forecasts across
multiple levels of temporal aggregation.

Combinations of these data types in a rectangular ‘tidy’ data structure
allow for the flexible application of
probabilistic-spatio-temporal-graph data analysis. For instance, the
combination of temporal and distributional vectors provides a dataset
suitable for working with time series forecasts.

#### Structure

1.  R as a *vectorised* statistics language (see also ‘Keep R weird’)
2.  What are vectors (and what are *records*)? A brief introduction to
    the vctrs package.
3.  Semantic variables vectors (time, distribution, spatial, graph, …)
4.  Basics of distributional vectors (single distribution types).
5.  Mixed type vectors of vectors. A brief showcase of the vecvec
    package.
6.  Operations on semantic vectors with the distributional package.
7.  Other semantic vectors (mixtime, graphvec, sf).
8.  Combining semantic variables (distributional+mixtime == forecasts)
